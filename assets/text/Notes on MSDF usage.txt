Text rendering is tricky. Like... REALLY tricky.

There was a paper published by Valve that detailed a method of rendering text in video games, in such a way that it looked good from a variety of distances
  using small textures, titled "Improved Alpha-Tested Magnification for Vector Textures and Special Effects."

While this does produce very smooth looking text with a very small texture, the integrity of sharp edges on rendered text is low.
Github user Chlumsky advanced the technique using "Multi-channel signed distance fields," (MSDF) where the three color channels are used
  to represent the signed-distance field (SDF) instead of just one. The MSDF method procduces significantly better results than SDF alone.
  While it does use three color channels (requiring the usage of 3x the memory of a greyscale SDF) (4x in this engine), the results are
  substantially better than an SDF of 2x resolution on both sides (4x total) - e.g., an MSDF of dimensions 16x16 produces far superior
  results to an SDF of dimension 32x32.
